            Santa Monica is a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California. The city came to Edenspiekermann because they wanted to create a new beautiful website that would make the process of finding and navigating information easy and intuitive to its people. As a User Experience Design Lead and Information Architect I currently play a key role in leading a team of multidisciplinary designers in this effort.</p>

            <h3 class="page-section-header">Challenge</h3>
            <p class="page-section-content">It’s not hard to imagine that a website designed 20 years ago doesn’t exactly fulfill the needs of the 21st century user or government. The current smgov.net site is organized by department and has many microsites with their own navigation and content standards, creating a sprawling and inconsistent user experience. The website totalling to 22,000 pages is in need of a complete overhaul.</p>

            <h3 class="page-section-header">Discovery phase</h3>
            <p class="page-section-content">When we started our partnership with the City of Santa Monica, their digital strategy was already determined and our task was to ensure that the City’s vision manifested itself through a user-focused digital experience on the new website.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Our team worked with 130+ stakeholders to gather insights into what internal and external users needed. The interviews have also helped to define the specifics of the work required to develop a digital 24/7/365 city hall.</p>

        </figure>
        <div class="col col-7 page-section">
            <p class="page-section-content padding-top-l">Following the interviews, we conducted the content audit which was our second major task. During this process we analyzed and assessed the content that lived on 22,000 pages of the current smgov.net. We quickly learned that the existing information architecture often fragmented user journey and hindered users’ ability to discover all that the City had to offer.</p>

        <div class="col col-7 page-section">
            <p class="page-section-content">Although departments operate in silos, users don’t perceive the City as a collection of departments. Instead, users see the City as a whole that is full of places and services for their benefit. For example, someone looking to start business in Santa Monica expects to find general information on the process steps in one place instead of needing to look for information scattered across different branches of government.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Another big insight was that an average user that comes to the City website has a mix of transaction-based and exploration-based needs so we cannot prioritize one or the other.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-l">The above insights bolstered our initial strategy for IA solution that put equal emphasis on enabling task completion and providing users with information and services they didn’t know they had.</p>
