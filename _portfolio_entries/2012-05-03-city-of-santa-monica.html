The city came to Edenspiekermann because they wanted to create a new beautiful website that would make the process of finding and navigating information easy and intuitive to its people.</p>
            <p>As a User Experience Design Lead and Information Architect I currently play a key role in leading a team of multidisciplinary designers in this effort.</p>

            <h3 class="page-section-header">Challenge</h3>
            <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-m">It’s not hard to imagine that a website designed 20 years ago doesn’t exactly fulfill the needs of the 21st century user or government. The current smgov.net site is organized by department and has many microsites with their own navigation and content standards, creating a sprawling and inconsistent user experience. The website totaling to 22,000 pages is in need of a complete overhaul.</p>

            <h3 class="page-section-header">Discovery phase</h3>
            <p class="page-section-content">When we started our partnership with the City of Santa Monica, their digital strategy was already determined and our task was to ensure that the City’s vision manifested itself through a user-focused digital experience on the new website.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Our team worked with 130+ stakeholders to gather insights into what internal and external users needed. The interviews have also helped to define the specifics of the work required to develop a digital 24/7/365 city hall.</p>

        </figure>
        <div class="col col-7 page-section">
            <p class="page-section-content padding-top-m">Following the interviews, we conducted the content audit which was our second major task. During this process we analyzed and assessed 22,000 pieces of content that lived across current City's digital ecosystem. We quickly learned that the existing information architecture often fragmented user journey and hindered users’ ability to discover all that the City had to offer.</p>

        <div class="col col-7 page-section">
            <p class="page-section-content">Although departments operate in silos, users don’t perceive the City as a collection of departments. Instead, users see the City as a whole that is full of places and services for their benefit. For example, someone looking to start business in Santa Monica expects to find general information on the process steps in one place instead of needing to look for information scattered across different branches of government.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Another big insight was that an average user that comes to the City website has a mix of transaction-based and exploration-based needs so we cannot prioritize one or the other.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">The above insights bolstered our initial strategy for IA solution that put equal emphasis on enabling task completion and providing users with information and services they didn’t know they had.</p>

		    <h3 class="page-section-header">Solution</h3>
        <p class="page-section-content">Rather than organizing the site by the city department we went for a more intuitive content organization by topic. Also, we made sure user has many ways to access the information they need. Below lists the underlying principles that will help to bring our topics-based IA concept to life:</p>
        <ul class="margin-block-end:0em padding-bottom-m">
          <li>Topics rather than city departments based main site navigation that help surface topics users care about, while highlighting city priorities.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Scalable site hierarchy expressed through a definition of a set of modular page types (content modeling and definition of content priority guides were crucial steps in this process).</li>
          <br>
          <li>An ever-present “I want to…” task component that provides users with one-click-away access to themed task/transaction list and, as a result, better facilitates user/City transactions, internally and externally.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Topics-based focused search experience to help user quickly search for information and then narrow down their search results.</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="page-section-content">Edenspiekermann is also tasked to create a visual identity system that would better represent City of Santa Monica as the 21st government that it already is. I am currently heavily involved in rethinking City’s brand architecture that carries over 65 logos. As soon as the new branding is signed-off by the City, we’ll start on building out the components for the design system and kick-off detailed page design phase.</p>
