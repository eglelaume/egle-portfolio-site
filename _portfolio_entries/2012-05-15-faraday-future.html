	        <p class="page-section-content">Our primary objective was to create a scalable design system that could facilitate the development of a uniform in-car user interface. Our work spanned various screens, including the center information display, door panels, and heads-up display. The task presented a rewarding challenge for our team, as designing for these distinct contexts greatly differed from creating interfaces for traditional digital screens.</p>

This feature adds an extra layer of immersion and interactivity to the overall user experience.</p>

        <p class="page-section-content">As a design lead, I introduced and implemented effective tools and workflows that not only helped my team build a scalable design system, but also ensured its sustainability and scalability for Faraday Future.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="page-section-content">To achieve this, we leveraged Sketch libraries to establish a comprehensive "single source of truth" for every symbol, and Abstract for collaborative screen layout versioning. Additionally, we utilized Zeplin for seamless handoff to engineers.

        <p class="page-section-content">Despite being equipped with thorough UX documentation from the project's inception, we continuously refined and optimized user flows during the design process. Furthermore, we played a crucial role in developing essential in-car experiences, including voice control and navigation systems.

<!--Creating the most connected car on the market means a lot of UX/UI design considerations. Being embedded in the client’s design team and working alongside their developers meant we could really understand the complex car ecosystem and create a design system that serves product needs. My biggest learning from this process is that eight months is definitely not enough time to fully realize a design system and get it rolled out organization-wide. Yet, our work resulted into a system that set a solid foundation for the internal design teams to continue working independently -->
