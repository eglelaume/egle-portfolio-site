	        <p class="page-section-content">Our main deliverable was to develop a scalable design system, allowing to build consistent in-car UI. The screens that we tackled included everything from center information display and door panels to heads up display.</p>
          <br>
	        <p class="page-section-content">As a design leader, I had to introduce tools and workflows that would help my team complete the work of building this new design system and also ensure that Faraday Future team will be able to maintain & build upon it in the long-term.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page-section-content">We used Sketch libraries to build up a “single source of truth” for every symbol and Abstract to collaborate on and version our screen layouts.  Finally, Zeplin was used for a hand off.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="page-section-content">Although we were presented with extensive UX documentation on the day one of the project, we improved upon many user flows as we were designing our way through the system. In addition to that, we were heavily involved in creating some of the core in-car experiences, such as voice control and navigation systems.</p>

		    <h3 class="page-section-header">Takeaway</h3>
        <p class="page-section-content">Creating the most connected car on the market means a lot of UX/UI design considerations. Being embedded in the client’s design team and working alongside their developers meant we could really understand the complex car ecosystem and create a design system that serves product needs. My biggest learning from this process is that eight months is definitely not enough time to fully realize a design system and get it rolled out organization-wide. Yet, our work resulted into a system that set a solid foundation for the internal design teams to continue working independently.</p>
