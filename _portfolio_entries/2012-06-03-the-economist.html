            <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">The Economist</a> is a weekly newspaper offering authoritative insight and opinion on the world we live in. I joined the paper's revamp team in London to build an MVP of the next <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Economist.com</a>. The ultimate goal was to create a more immersive online reading experience by implementing streamlined responsive interface with faster load times. Also, users had to be enabled to navigate between stories quicker and be able to find more content that appeals to them easier. </p>  
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">With different user segments in mind and by taking into account content, workfows and technological constraints, the product vision was defined what then helped to derive a design language.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">People visit Economist.com to read so, naturally, improving actual user reading experience was a top priority. Together with a superb <a href="https://www.edenspiekermann.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Edenspiekermann</a> (Berlin) team we started off with creating an index of the different article types. I then had a chance to collaboratively work on designing the basic article and its building blocks and translate those into a visual look and feel of different article types, such as, Leader and Blog Post.</p>

            established, the overview pages, such as 'home', 'section' and 'blog landing', could be assembled by modularly combining re-useable components.</p>

            <br>  
            <p class="page-section-content">I iterated on design comps for different users states, such as, anonymous, logged in and registered, logged in and subscriber. I was also fully responsible for producing working prototypes in Marvel/Framer JS and worked closely with developers to ship working components. You can see snipets from my explorations below.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">Whilst working at The Economist I had a chance to meaningfully participate in product ideating, prototyping, and development process. The revamp project had a highly iterative product development environment and Iâ€™ve learnt to work agile and think in sprints. I also had a chance to work closely with developers and do small contributions to the code base and, as a result, got more comfortable with using Git and improved my front-end development skills. At the moment of writing the project is still ongoing with around 30% of the site in beta and visible to a random 10% of users - <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">check</a> if you are lucky to see it live.</p>
