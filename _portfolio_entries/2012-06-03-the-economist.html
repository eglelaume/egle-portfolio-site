            <p class="page-section-content">The Economist is a weekly newspaper offering authoritative insight and opinion on the world we live in. Back in 2015 the publication decided to modernize the infrastructure of their online outlets and provide its readers a more immersive online reading experience through a redesigned <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">economist.com</a>. I joined their London team as a digital designer to be part of these efforts.</p>

            <h3 class="page-section-header">Challenge</h3>
            <p class="page-section-content">There were a few reasons why The Economist needed a new digital home. Aesthetically their website felt dated which didn’t do justice in attracting new readers or advertisers. In addition to that, the content was organized to match print publication’s structure what amplified confusion rather than coherency to its readers.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">It took quite a few workshops before we started shaping up our product vision and the structure for the new website.</p>

        	<h3 class="page-section-header">Process</h3>
            <p class="page-section-content">For the initial site concept we focused on designing a set of core components for the most important user journeys.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">We worked together with our partner agency to create a flexible design system that not only retained legacy features of the brand personality but also enabled editors to logically represents a wide breadth of content published by The Economist, such as, leadership blogs, news articles, research and reports, etc. It goes without saying that the system had to be modular enough to easily use and expand on in the future.</p>

          </figure>
          <div class="col col-7 page-section">
            <p class="page-section-content">The new website was built in React which I found to be a perfect environment for collaboration between designers and developers. Since React components divided the new UI into design elements (button, form, form-field, spinner, etc.), it was easy to iterate and evolve the design system right in code.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">By combining these reusable/modular building blocks, we managed to design all key page types and bring the new <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">economist.com</a> to life.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">Throughout this project, I observed how striving to satisfy high-paying advertisers' needs was prioritized over designing uninterrupted reading experiences to our visitors. That inevitably led to quite a bit of short‐sightedness in some UX decision making and, also, caused some frustration within the team. If we had asked “is this improving our reader's experience?” as much as we asked "will this make our advertisers happy?“, we would have launched a more intuitive and polished product.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Despite all of that, I am still very glad I had a chance to work alongside some very talented people and meaningfully participate in The Economist's new website ideation, prototyping, and development process.</p>
