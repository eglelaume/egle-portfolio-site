The nature of the resulting work is confidential, but I would like to talk about how I approached the process and what I’ve learnt.</p>

		    <p class="page-section-content">Day one of the sprint was all about trying to understand what we were trying to solve. In this phase, I moderated a bunch of exercises, such as, lightning talks, which helped to unlock each participant’s knowledge; “How might we” session and affinity mapping that helped to reframe problems as opportunities; and user journey mapping that helped to dive deep into user experience. As an external facilitator, my task was to ask the right questions to help people focus and ensure that understanding and definition of the problem is complete.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="page-section-content">After individual presentations, we voted for the best solutions and decided as a team what to prototype in order to best answer our sprint questions. We ended the day with creating a storyboard that defined each interaction with a user in a step-by-step process. This became the specification for our prototype.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="page-section-content">This is where we diverged from a regular design sprint process a bit because although we built the prototype, its validation sessions were up to the client to conduct in a few days following the sprint. We used Keynote to built this interactive prototype which client successfully used across the organisation to test their hypothesis.</p>

		    <p class="page-section-content">Not every problem needs a design sprint, but it worked really well for the team at McKinsey & Company. It was incredibly fun three days and it felt like we really helped their team to answer a few critical business questions. I now try using Google Design Sprint techniques as a part of my team's design process whenever we need to increase creativity and quickly generate new ideas.</p>
