The nature of the resulting work is confidential, but I would like to talk about how we approached the process and what I’ve learnt.</p>

		    <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-m">Day one of the sprint was all about trying to understand what we were trying to solve. In this phase, I moderated a bunch of exercises, such as, lightning talks, which helped to unlock each participant’s knowledge; “How Might We” session and affinity mapping that helped to reframe problems as opportunities; and user journey mapping that helped to dive deep into user experience. As an external facilitator, my task was to ask the right questions to help the participants focus and ensure that understanding and definition of the problem is complete.</p>

        <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-m">As a result of day one, team agreed upon the goal and business opportunity for the sprint, defined the problem of the new feature and aligned on priority audience.</p>

Although the participants seemed intimidated by the task at first, they ended up doing great in coming up with detailed sketch solutions on paper.</p>

        <p class="page-section-content">After individual presentations, we voted for the best solutions and decided as a team what to prototype in order to best answer our sprint questions.

        <br>
        <p class="page-section-content">This is where we diverged from a regular design sprint process a bit because although we built the prototype, its validation sessions were up to the client to conduct in a few days following the sprint. We used Keynote to built this interactive prototype which client successfully used across the organization to test their hypothesis.</p>

		    <h3 class="page-section-header">Conclusion</h3>
		    <p class="page-section-content">Not every problem needs a design sprint, but it worked really well for the team at McKinsey & Company. In only three days we succeeded in answering a few important business questions and produced something tangible. Personally, I was glad to learn a bunch of Design Sprint techniques that I now enjoy using as a part of my team's design process whenever we need to increase creativity and quickly generate new ideas.</p>
