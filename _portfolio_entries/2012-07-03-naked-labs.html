            <p class="page-section-content">The Naked Labs 3D body scanner tracks the user’s shape, measurements, body fat %, and weight to give insights into how the user lifestyle affects their health. The team at Naked Labs and Edenspiekermann got together to create their new brand and website experience that would feel as premium and thought-out as their product.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">When we started our partnership with the Naked Labs team, their old website didn’t do a good job in showcasing company’s vision, was lacking engaging storytelling around the product, and didn’t provide a robust customer support experience. The client wanted a new website to help them nurture their product pre-order signups and ultimately build a long term community around their brand.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">As a basis for the brand concept and website development, we started with 3 day immersion phase at the Naked Labs offices.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Our first step was to fully understand Naked Labs business, the environment in which they operated and identify opportunities for their new brand. Besides conducting a focused desk research and holding a series of stakeholder interviews, one of my first tasks was to leverage the user information of the company’s 25-person beta test group to develop archetypes representative of the priority audiences the new website needed to engage with.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="page-section-content">By asking a simple question - <b>what role Naked Labs scanner plays in your life?</b> - I analyzed the behavioral patterns that the beta test group users shared and elevated their insights to archetypes.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">What I arrived at was seven archetypes that guided our decision making around features, functionality and content for the new Naked website.</p>

        <p class="page-section-content">Our next step was to create messaging matrix that defined high-level communication concept for each of the target groups across different communication channels. Together with Naked Labs team, we crafted a bunch of messages that sounded something like below:</p>
        <ul style="margin-block-end:0em">
          <li>“Give us 20 seconds and we’ll guide you back on track.”</li>
          <li>“We track the small goals so you can focus on and reach the big goal.”</li>
          <li>“You are not doing it alone!”</li>
          <li>“Naked is a way to see exactly how your workouts affect your body.”</li>
          <li>“We will add facts to your feelings.”</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="col col-12 page-section padding-top-m padding-bottom-m">
                <a href="{{ site.images_path }}/faraday-future/egle-dan-working-session.jpg"><img class="full-width image-block" src="{{ site.images_path }}/faraday-future/FF_91_Exterior_1.jpg"></a>
        </figure>
        <p class="page-section-content">At the same time, to spark some inspiration for a website-specific content, we looked at other product websites that Naked Labs team loved. We came up with How Might We (HMW) questions and invited the Naked Labs team to generate ideas with us. Some of these questions included:</p>
        <ul style="margin-block-end:0em">
          <li>“xxx”</li>
          <li>“xxx”</li>
          <li>“xxx”</li>
          <li>“xxx”</li>
          <li>“xxx”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="page-section-content padding-top-m">We drilled into a bunch of the best in class examples of product showcase, technical specifications, editorial content and support section pages and brainstormed on the specific ways certain features and content experiences could manifest in the new Naked website experience.</p>
        <figure class="col col-12 page-section padding-top-m padding-bottom-m">

        </figure>
        <p class="page-section-content">Through ideation & competitive analysis, we narrowed our question to: <b>How might we create a website that combines a visually stunning brand and product showcase with rich lifestyle content experiences?</b> We used this question to guide our further work.</p>
