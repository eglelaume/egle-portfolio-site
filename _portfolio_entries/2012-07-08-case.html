            CASE project was set to re-platform <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">The Economist’s</a> e-commerce journey and, also, to create a new ‘manage my account’ dashboard from which a logged-in user could manage their subscriptions, bookmarks, comments and would be presented with different promotions.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-l">I led visual design process and worked alongside a lead UX architect to create responsive solutions. I focused on visual brand integration and helped to improve user experience by rethinking all aspects of the user interaction. The image below gives you a taste for different user scenarios I had to focus on whilst working on the CASE. </p>

            I had to deliver effective visual design and some improved UI solutions while articulating <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">The Economist</a> brand values. The tricky part was that the CASE project was happening alongside The Economist <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/portfolio/the-economist/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">new website's development</a>, meaning, I had to base my design rationale on the visual styles that were still fluctuating. As a result, some uncertainty was brought into the project's progression and I had to make sure to find ways to fulfil team's and stakeholders's expectations.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">In order to achieve that, I put together a style guide that helped to document important decisions before starting work and ensured that globally distributed CASE team, the stakeholders and I were all on the same page from the outset. It also helped to introduce a level of visual consistency. You can see snippets from the style guide below.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">My day-to-day tasks involved translating low fidelity annotated wires into high fidelity click through prototypes so that marketing team could quickly review and test parts of the journeys. I mostly used Marvel and I found that “close to real” looking mocks really improved product owners feedback turnaround time.</p>
            <br>
            One of the flows that required the most of stakeholders feedback was subscription renewals flow. You can see a snippet of different user state interactions I worked on below followed by just a few of many mocks I did for ‘manage my account’ dashboard.</p>

             The project taught me a lot about working as part of a globally distributed team of stakeholders. CASE is a huge scale project and is still ongoing.
