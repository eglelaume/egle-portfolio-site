            CASE project was set to re-platform The Economist’s eCommerce journey and, also, to create a new ‘manage my account’ dashboard from which a logged in user could manage their subscriptions, bookmarks, comments and would be presented with different promotions.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-l">I led visual design process and worked alongside UX architect <a href="http://www.rickdeeks.co.uk/index.html" target="_blank" class="inline-link"> Rick Deeks </a> to create responsive solutions to the eCommerce journeys. I focused on visual brand integration, helped to improve user experience and, also, find better interaction design and usability solutions.</p>

            I had to deliver effective visual design solutions while articulating The Economist brand values. CASE is a commercial project of The Economist and it has a lot of constrains when it comes to what is “allowed” visually. I had to translate freshly established/still in development revamp style guides into CASE context and then clearly articulate my design rationale through presenting my work to my peers and stakeholders.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">In order to achieve the latter and due to the fact that all teams working on this project were remote from each other, I put together a style guide including UX design patterns and some visual styles. I was the only visual designer on the project and I think that using a style guide helped to document important decisions before starting work and ensured that me, the remote teams, and the stakeholders of the project were all on the same page from the outset. It also helped to introduce a level of visual consistency.</p>

            The Economist users have an array of different entry points to the website and therefore there were a lot of different user flows defined as a result of CASE. My day to day tasks involved translating low fidelity wires into high fidelity click through prototypes so that marketing team could quickly review and test parts of the journeys. I mostly used Marvel and I found that “close to real” looking high fidelity mocks really improved product owners feedback turnaround time. </p>

            For the project of this scale it would have been helpful to wireframe in HTML rather than using traditional UX software Axure. Mainly because it was quite difficult to read and edit annotations that describe an interaction, instead of communicating ideas with HTML wireframe that presents design right there on the page.</p>
            <br>
            Working on CASE made think about designing flows rather than pages. The project was highly transformational and difficult for the fact that it had a geographically distributed team.
