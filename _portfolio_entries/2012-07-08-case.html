            CASE project was set to re-platform The Economist’s eCommerce journey and, also, to create a new ‘manage my account’ dashboard from which a logged in user could manage their subscriptions, bookmarks, comments and would be presented with different promotions.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content padding-bottom-l">I led visual design process and worked alongside UX architect <a href="http://www.rickdeeks.co.uk/index.html" target="_blank" class="inline-link"> Rick Deeks </a> to create responsive solutions to the eCommerce journeys. I focused on visual brand integration, helped to improve user experience and, also, find better interaction design and usability solutions.</p>

            I had to deliver effective visual design and some improved UI solutions while articulating The Economist brand values. The tricky part was that CASE project was happening alongside The Economist new website's development, meaning, I had to base my design rationale on the visual styles that were still flactuating. As a result, that would sometimes bring in some uncertainty into the project's progression and I had to make sure to find ways to fullfill team's and stakeholders's expectations.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">In order to achieve that, I put together a style guide that helped to document important decisions before starting work and ensured that globally distributed CASE team, the stakeholders and I were all on the same page from the outset. It also helped to introduce a level of visual consistency. You can see snipets from the style guide below.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">
            The Economist users have an array of different entry points to the website and therefore there were a lot of different user flows defined as a result of CASE. My day to day tasks involved translating low fidelity annotated wires into high fidelity click through prototypes so that marketing team could quickly review and test parts of the journeys. I mostly used Marvel and I found that “close to real” looking mocks really improved product owners feedback turnaround time.</p>
            <br>
            One of the flows that required the most of stakeholders feedback was subscription renewals flow. You can see a snipet of different user state interactions I worked on below followed by just a few of many mocks I did for ‘manage my account’ dashboard.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">
            CASE is a still ongoing project. It was a revealing experience to work on an ecommerce project, as I really started to think about designing flows rather than pages. I addition, it taught me a lot about working closely with stakeholders and globally distributed teams.
