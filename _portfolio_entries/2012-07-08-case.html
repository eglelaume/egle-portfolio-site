            <p class="page-section-content">In addition to working on <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">economist.com</a> redesign, during my time at The Economist I was also involved with the project code named CASE. On this project, I helped to redesign dashboard from which a logged-in user could manage their subscriptions, bookmarks and comments. This meant I had to get my head around the specifics of ten use cases that included everything from “I want to renew an active subscription” to “I want to update my payment details” to “I want to activate a gift subscription”, to mention a few. </p>

            <p class="page-section-content">Owned by different departments, CASE and the <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">economist.com</a> revamp project ran on different timelines and had different launch dates. The tricky part for me in this setting was that I had to keep on moving forward with creating UI for the e-commerce pages although the visual styles for The Economist's new website were still being determined.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="page-section-content">Striving for visual consistency, I created and maintained a simple styleguide that was really helpful in aligning globally distributed and internal digital teams.</p>

            <p class="page-section-content">The task that I was mostly involved with towards the end of the project was "translating" low fidelity wireframes to high fidelity click through prototypes. I used Marvel to create quick mock-ups that significantly improved stakeholder feedback turnaround time. You can see a few of many mocks I did for ‘manage my account’ dashboard below.</p>

             It was challenging yet fun experience to work as a part of a globally distributed CASE team. With many stakeholders involved, CASE was a huge undertaking and I was really impressed with my team’s dedication in making it happen on time. </p>
