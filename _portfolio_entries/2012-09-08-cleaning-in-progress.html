    <h3 class="page-section-header"><strong>Project overview</strong></h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">I was tasked to produce a cover illustration and a five page layout for the cover story of the Global Trade Review (GTR) magazine. A flat style illustration introduces a progress report on the trade finance industryâ€™s effort to becoming more environmentally and socially responsible. I drew the illustration in Adobe Illustrator.

            <h6 class="page-section-content"> Following the cover illustration I enjoyed designing the layout for the cover story because it gave me a chance to extend the story further. I went for a two column layout on a seven column grid (leaving one column empty). This gave me more space on the page meaning I could come up with the design that felt continuous from one page to another. Road was a very helpful element to achieve that.</h6>
