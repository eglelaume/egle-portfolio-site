    <h3 class="page-section-header">Project overview</h3>
    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p>I was tasked to produce a cover illustration and a five page layout for the cover story of the Global Trade Review (GTR) magazine. A flat style illustration introduces a progress report on the trade finance industry’s effort to becoming more environmentally and socially responsible. I drew the illustration in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

            <div class="page-section-content">
                <p>For inside pages I decided to go for a two column layout on a seven column grid (leaving one column empty). An extra column gave me some extra space on the page meaning I could accommodate the design that felt continuous from one page to another. Road was a very helpful element to achieve that.</p>

    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p>Global Trade Review (GTR) is a publisher and event organiser for the global trade, commodity and supply chain finance industries. I was tasked to illustrate the GTR magazine cover story that investigated questionable China’s commodities sector activities and a company nicknamed ‘the Qingdao Whale’. Whale has a great shape so it was a delight to explore and draw it.</p>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Approach</h3>
    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p> Ideally, the drawing had to include some ships or harbour to reflect on trading aspect of the story and it also had to illustrate the concept of <em>searching</em> or <em>hidden</em>.</p>
        <p>I started off with sketching a number of different cover versions and after the winning drawing was selected I scanned and finalised the hand-drawn sketch in Illustrator. You can see the final sketch versus finalised .pdf below.</p>

    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p>The Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) that were deciding the rules of world trade for the past 70 years are starting to face organisations which could rival them. The cover illustration and a four-page magazine spread for GTR magazine explores the concept of how old and new could co-exist in one space.</p>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Concept</h3>
    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p>After discussing the concept with my team, we decided to go for a living space analogy. The idea was to show that something very contemporary is going to be built on the top of something established.</p>
        <p>As a result, the illustration depicts a section of a Roman style upper-class country house featuring rather old-fashioned decor put against a fragment of a blueprint drawing for a contemporary house that accentuates simple proportions, open layouts and flexible living space.</p>
