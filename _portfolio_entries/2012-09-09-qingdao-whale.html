    <h3 class="page-section-header">Project overview</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">I was asked to illustrate the concept of a questionable China’s commodities sector activities. The cover story’s focus was a company nicknamed ‘the Qingdao Whale’. After a lot of brainstorming and trying out different compositions, I decided that the cover illustration should mainly consist of what is under water. I chose whale as a focal point of the illustration.</br>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Approach</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content"> I sketched a number of different versions for the same concept. After researching into and trying different styles of illustration, I decided that for the Chinese themed cover paper cut style illustration would be best suited. Once the winning drawing was selected I scanned and finalised the hand-drawn sketch in Illustrator.
