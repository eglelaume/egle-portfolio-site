    <h3 class="page-section-header">Project overview</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">I was asked to illustrate the concept of questionable China’s commodities sector activities. The cover story’s focus was a company nicknamed ‘the Qingdao Whale’ so it was a no brainer to make whale a focal point of the cover. Whale has a great shape so it was a delight to explore and draw it.</br>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Approach</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content"> Ideally, the drawing had to have some ships or harbour to reflect on trading aspect of the story and it also had to illustrate the concept of <em>searching</em> or <em>hidden</em>.
    I started off with sketching a number of different cover versions and after the winning drawing was selected I scanned and finalised the hand-drawn sketch in Illustrator. You can see the final sketch versus finalised .pdf below.
