    <h6 class="page-section-content">Global Trade Review (GTR) is event organiser for the global trade, commodity, export and supply chain finance industries. Whilst working there I designed various marketing collateral that was used prior and, also, at their events. My day-to-day tasks included creating brochures, leaflets, certificates, thombstones, large format artwork, presentations and motion graphics. Please see some pictures below showing the products I designed that where used at different GTR events.
