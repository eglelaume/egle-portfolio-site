    <h6 class="page-section-content">The examples below are just a few out of many examples of enewsletters I've designed whilst working at Global Trade Review (GTR). Enewsletter is an important piece of direct marketing so it is very important not only get the design right but also make sure it works amongst different email providers. I worked a lot together with our developers team on testing redesigned GTR enewsletters.</h6>
