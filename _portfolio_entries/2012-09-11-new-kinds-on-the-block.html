    <h3 class="page-section-header">Project overview</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">The Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) that were deciding the rules of world trade for the past 70 years are starting to face organisations which could rival them. I was asked to illustrate the concept of old and new co-existing in one space. In addition to cover illustration, I was also tasked to design a four-page spread for the cover story.</br>

    <strong>My role:</strong> art director, illustrator, designer.

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Concept</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content"> I decided to go for a living space analogy. The idea was to show that something very contemporary is going to be built on the top of something established and they both will need to co-exist.</br>
    </br>
    As a result, the cover illustration depicts Roman style upper-class country house section featuring rather old-fashioned decor put against a fragment of a blueprint drawing for a contemporary house that accentuates simple proportions, open layouts and flexible living space.
