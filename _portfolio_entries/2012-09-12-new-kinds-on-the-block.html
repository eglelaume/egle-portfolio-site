    <h6 class="page-section-content">The Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) that were deciding the rules of world trade for the past 70 years are starting to face organisations which could rival them. I was asked to illustrate the concept.

<section class="container page-section project-explanation"> 
    <h6 class="page-section-content"> I decided to go for a living space analogy to illustrate the cover story. The idea was to show that something new is going to be built on something established.  Although both will need to co-exist, the old world will need to share the space with the new one. As a result, the illustration depicts an old-fashioned, roman palace like house put against a fragment of a blueprint sketch of a new house.</h6>
