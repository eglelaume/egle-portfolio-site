    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p>Global Trade Review (GTR) is a publisher and event organiser for the global trade, commodity and supply chain finance industries. I was tasked to illustrate the GTR magazine cover story that investigated questionable China’s commodities sector activities and a company nicknamed ‘the Qingdao Whale’. Whale has a great shape so it was a delight to explore and draw it.</p>
        <p><strong>My role:</strong> art director, illustrator, graphic designer.</p>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Approach</h3>
    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p> Ideally, the drawing had to include some ships or harbour to reflect on trading aspect of the story and it also had to illustrate the concept of <em>searching</em> or <em>hidden</em>.</p>
        <p>I started off with sketching a number of different cover versions and after the winning drawing was selected I scanned and finalised the hand-drawn sketch in Illustrator. You can see the final sketch versus finalised .pdf below.</p>
