        <p>Global Trade Review (GTR) is event organiser for the global trade, commodity, export and supply chain finance industries. Whilst working there I designed various marketing collateral that was used prior and, also, at their events. My day-to-day tasks included creating brochures, leaflets, certificates, tombstones, large format artwork, presentations and motion graphics. Please see some pictures below showing the products I designed that where used at different GTR events.</p>
        <p><strong>My role:</strong> graphic designer.</p>

                <p>With up to thirty events per year there was a lot of marketing materials to be produced. I would sometimes need to meet extremely tight deadlines in order to send artwork with the latest updates to print in time.</p>

                <p>I would normally work from InDesign templates to produce branding materials. Although working from templates means the task becomes less creative, I think templating is the key in ensuring consistency throughout all marketing collateral.</p>
