            <p>Eleven Tigers is electronic music producer based in London. I was asked to design Eleven Tigers branded USB flash drive that had to look like a tiger head. Additionally, I had to deal with printers from China to manufacture the product. The limited edition flash drive was used to hold the second Eleven Tigers album called 111.</p>
            <p><strong>My role:</strong> graphic/product designer.</p>

        <div class="page-section-content">
            <p>After discussing client's vision for the product I went straight into Google SketchUp and started prototyping. You can see the snippets from the 3D product drawings as they were supplied to printers below.</p>

        <div class="page-section-content">
            <p>I went for an extremely stylized tiger head design incorporating prominent 111 logo on the front. Around two hundred flash drives were dispatched worldwide to Eleven Tigers fans who crowd-funded the album.</p>
