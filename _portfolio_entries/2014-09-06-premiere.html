        <div class="page-section-content">
            <p>Premiere is a Lithuanian luxury jewellery retailer headquartered in Vilnius. I was tasked with designing a new responsive website for the retailer by also giving the brand a refresh. Website is still in development.</p>
            <p><strong>My role:</strong> graphic/web designer.</p>

        <h3 class="page-section-header">Designing visual style</h3>
        <div class="page-section-content">
            <p>Although Premiere branding had already been established, its visual style didn't convey the message of luxury. After talking to the client, I realised that Premiere stocks wide range of jewellery and my client wanted to appeal not only to those able to afford the most expensive products.</p>
            <p>I decided that the brand needed to have more luxury upmarket aesthetic but not scare away those that could only afford cheaper jewellery. With that in mind, I came up with a bold colour palette dominated by dark royal blue and the highlight colours of cyan and red. Also, put together some playful yet minimal typography combinations.</p>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Website structure</h3>
    <div class="page-section-content">
        <p>In line with a new visual style my client wanted a well-structured and clean looking website that emphasized beautiful products and gave customers a user friendly environment to shop online. After sketching out a few quick concepts and putting together some style tiles, I got straight into Photoshop.</p>

        <p>My brief was to create a pre-checkout page that would prevent customer of abandoning the shopping cart. I made sure to include a large product image, related items, free shipping and product information and the ability to add the item to one's wish list if customer is not quite ready for it yet. Social media is a big part of Premiere's brand strategy so I decided to weave in social sharing options there too. You can see the pre-checkout page on the left below along with the contacts page on the right.

        <div class="page-section-content">
            <p>I enjoyed working with my client to help give Premiere brand a refresh and build its web presence. Although I did prepare designs for different devices, client had to postpone a responsive website development and only focused on the desktop version for now. It was great fun working on it and I hope that the responsive site will be up soon.</p>
