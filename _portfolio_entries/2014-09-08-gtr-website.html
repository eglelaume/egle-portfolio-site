    <h3 class="page-section-header"><strong>Project overview</strong></h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">I planned and led design process of the new responsive website for GTR. Was responsible for site-map architecture followed by website wireframes and mock-ups for multiple devices, also, at a later stage of the project, UI testing. Played a key role in liaison with numerous teams including web developers, editorial and marketing. The latter included face to face meetings, conference calls and a use of online collaboration tools such as Podio. </h6>
