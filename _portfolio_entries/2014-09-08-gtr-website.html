    <h3 class="page-section-header"><strong>Project overview</strong></h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">I planned and led design process of the new responsive website for GTR. Was responsible for site-map architecture followed by website wireframes and mock-ups for multiple devices, also, at a later stage of the project, UI testing. Played a key role in liaison with numerous teams including web developers, editorial and marketing. The latter included face to face meetings, conference calls and a use of online collaboration tools such as Podio. </h6>

    <h3 class="page-section-header"><strong>Sketching and wireframing</strong></h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">Taking into account that GTR user is often on the go, it was very important to get a mobile version of the site right. My focus in mobile version of the website was intentional navigation. Below are the snippets from the wireframes that were provided to developers to demonstrate how I'd like mobile navigation to work.</h6>
