        <h3 class="page-section-header">Project overview</h3>
        <h6 class="page-section-content">I planned and led design process of the Global Trade Review (GTR) digital rebrand. Apart of the new responsive website, I had to also design eNewsletters and confirmation emails. Was responsible for site map architecture followed by wireframes and mock-ups for multiple devices, also, at a later stage of the project, UI testing. I played a key role in liaison with numerous teams including web developers, editorial and marketing. The latter involved face to face meetings, conference calls and a use of online collaboration tools such as Podio.

        <h3 class="page-section-header">Information architecture</h3>
        <h6 class="page-section-content">A new responsive website for GTR was aimed to bring content of two different sites, news and events, together and make it accessible to users from their different devices.
        Challenging but yet rewarding part of the project was that apart of visual design, I was heavily involved in analysing all different online personas who will be interacting with our site. Who are our users and what's the difference between a registered and a non-registered one? Will the new users be created in Wordpress or will the data be fetched from CRM?</br>
        </br>
        All this brainstorming, resulted into me drawing up a site map together with some diagrams illustrating different user journeys and flows that where really helpful in communicating our ideas to developers team. You can see snippets from my sketches below.</h6>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">Wireframes</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">After the structure of the site was set I moved onto creating wireframes using an online UI prototyping tool called Moqups. This HTML5 app has a great collection of various UI stencils and allows importing images, meaning I could put together some high fidelity webpage wireframes for different devices.
    After running the mock-ups by my company directors I moved on to creating some more detailed comps in Photoshop, some of which you can see below.</h6>

    <h3 class="page-section-header">eNewsletters design</h3>
    <h6 class="page-section-content">In line with the new website I also designed GTR eNewsletters. I had to design global eNewsletter for news along with the regional events eNewsletter. I aimed for a clutter free look with a featured news story or event on the top. Legible type and large elements are aimed to make user click through to our website.</h6>

        <h6 class="page-section-content">I wanted to keep the design on-brand and aimed for a clean and minimal design aesthetic.
        "Open Sans" font was used throughout the site because it has a great legibility and neutral, yet friendly appearance.</br>
        </br>
        I used different font weights and colours to establish visual hierarchy. Regional content was colour coded and the highlight colour of mustard yellow was used throughout the site for call-to-action buttons.</h6>

    <h6 class="page-section-content">Since the website was launched, weâ€™ve had lots of great feedback not only from our users but from our competitors too. However, the scope of the project has expanded even before the site was launched and there is a lot of space for improvement that could be implemented during the future developments of the website.</h6>
