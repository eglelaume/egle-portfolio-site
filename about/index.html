            <h5>My story</h5>
            <p>I'm a product design leader based in Los Angeles, and I've spent over 10 years working in a variety of settings, from early-stage startups to established companies and digital agencies.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Throughout my journey, I've honed my skills in collaborating with product managers, analysts, and engineers to create amazing products that delight both customers and businesses. Whether it's in mobility, automotive, technology, government, or publishing, I'm passionate about designing experiences that make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In my current role as a Product Design Manager at <a href="https://www.bird.co/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"> Bird</a>, I lead a lean team of designers who tackle multiple products, from the Bird rider app and the Bird fleet manager app to internal servicing tools and new products for Bird partners.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As a design leader, I'm just as comfortable rolling up my sleeves and diving into hands-on work as I am guiding teams to achieve strategic goals. I work closely with the leaders of product management, engineering, and data to ensure design execution aligns with the overall vision and delivers measurable results.</p>
