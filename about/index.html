            <h5>Experience</h5>
            <p>I am a Los Angeles based Senior Product Design Manager with 9+ years of in-house and agency-side experience.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I currently work at electric scooter company <a href="https://www.bird.co/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"> Bird</a> where I enjoy guiding my team through focused work that lead to both customer and business results.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Previously, I was a UX Design Director at <a href="https://www.edenspiekermann.com/us/" target="_blank" class="inline-link"> Edenspiekermann</a> agency, where I owned and guided my team’s design processes, methodologies and activities from concept through to finished product. I enjoyed coaching my team through challenges as much as being a hands-on member of the team at all stages of the project.</p>
			<br>
			<p>While at Edenspiekermann, I have created digital products and experiences for brands in automotive, technology, government, publishing and finance. My most recent project includes leading a team of six product designers in creating UI for 10+ unique interactive screens within Faraday Future’s electric vehicle.</p>
